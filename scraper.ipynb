As Forbes was a\\nScotsman\\n, he probably pronounced the name\\n/\\nˈ\\np\\nɪ\\nt\\ns\\nb\\nər\\nə\\n/\\nPITS\\n-bər-ə\\n(similar to\\nEdinburgh\\n).\\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a\\nborough\\non April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\\n\"Be it enacted by the\\nPennsylvania State Senate\\nand\\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"\\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city\\'s name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final\\nh\\nwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.\\nAfter a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the\\nh\\nwas reversed.\\nThe\\nPittsburg Press\\ncontinued spelling the city without an\\nh\\nuntil 1921.\\nHistory\\nMain article:\\nHistory of Pittsburgh\\nFor a chronological guide, see\\nTimeline of Pittsburgh\\n.\\nHistorical claims\\nKingdom of France\\n1690s–1763\\nGreat Britain\\n1681–1781\\nUnited States\\n1776–present\\nNative Americans\\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the\\nShawnee\\nand several other settled groups of\\nNative Americans\\n.\\nShannopin\\'s Town\\nwas an 18th-century\\nLenape\\n(Delaware) town located roughly from where\\nPenn Avenue\\nis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to\\nGeorge Croghan\\n, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington\\'s Landing, formerly\\nHerr\\'s Island\\n, in what is now the\\nLawrenceville\\nneighborhood.\\n18th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Revolution\\nFort Pitt Block House\\n, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer\\nRobert de La Salle\\nfrom\\nQuebec\\nduring his 1669 expedition down the\\nOhio River\\n.\\n[\\nbetter\\xa0source\\xa0needed\\n]\\nEuropean pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European\\nfur traders\\nestablished area posts and settlements.\\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite\\nCanada\\nwith\\nFrench Louisiana\\nvia the rivers.\\nDuring 1753–1754, the British hastily built\\nFort Prince George\\nbefore a larger French force drove them off. The French built\\nFort Duquesne\\nbased on LaSalle\\'s 1669 claims. The\\nFrench and Indian War\\n, the North American front of the\\nSeven Years\\' War\\n, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General\\nEdward Braddock\\nwas dispatched with Major\\nGeorge Washington\\nas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.\\nThe British and colonial force were defeated at\\nBraddock\\'s Field\\n. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on\\nFort Pitt\\n, named after\\nWilliam Pitt the Elder\\n, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\\nDuring\\nPontiac\\'s War\\n, a loose confederation of Native American tribes\\nlaid siege to Fort Pitt\\nin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel\\nHenry Bouquet\\ndefeated a portion of the besieging force at the\\nBattle of Bushy Run\\n. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the\\nIroquois Confederacy\\n, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768\\nTreaty of Fort Stanwix\\n, the\\nPenns\\nwere allowed to purchase the modern region from the\\nIroquois\\n. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".\\nBoth the\\nColony of Virginia\\nand the\\nProvince of Pennsylvania\\nclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the\\nMason–Dixon line\\nwestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,\\nBedford County, Pennsylvania\\nwas created to govern the frontier.\\nOn April 16, 1771, the city\\'s first civilian local government was created as\\nPitt Township\\n.\\nWilliam Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\\nFollowing the\\nAmerican Revolution\\n, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the\\nOhio Country\\n. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the\\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\\nwas started, and in 1787, the\\nPittsburgh Academy\\nwas chartered. Unrest during the\\nWhiskey Rebellion\\nof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the\\nAppalachian Mountains\\nor through the\\nGreat Lakes\\n.\\nFort Pitt\\n(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the\\nNorthwest Territory\\n.\\n19th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Civil War\\nThe\\nMonongahela River\\nand its surroundings in 1857\\nLithograph\\nof Pittsburgh by\\nOtto Krebs\\n(before 1874)\\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the\\nLewis and Clark Expedition\\n.\\nPreparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when\\nMeriwether Lewis\\npurchased a\\nkeelboat\\nthat would later be used to ascend the\\nMissouri River\\n.\\nThe\\nWar of 1812\\ncut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\\nIn the 1830s, many\\nWelsh people\\nfrom the\\nMerthyr\\nsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the\\nMerthyr Rising\\n. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the\\nAllegheny Mountains\\n. The\\nGreat Fire of Pittsburgh\\ndestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the\\nGreat Famine\\n. By 1857, Pittsburgh\\'s 1,000 factories were consuming 22\\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from\\nGermany\\n.\\nBurning of Union Depot during the\\nPittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the\\nUnderground Railroad\\nin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.\\nThe Merchant\\'s Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.\\nSometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850\\nFugitive Slave Act\\n, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\\nThe\\nAmerican Civil War\\nboosted the city\\'s economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.\\nAndrew Carnegie\\nbegan steel production in 1875 at the\\nEdgar Thomson Steel Works\\nin\\nNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania\\n, which evolved into the\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\n. He adopted the\\nBessemer process\\nto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\\n20th century\\nAn aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902\\nSteel mills in the\\nStrip District\\nin 1906\\nIn 1901,\\nJ. P. Morgan\\nand attorney\\nElbert H. Gary\\nmerged\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\nand several other companies into\\nU.S. Steel\\n. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the\\nnation\\'s eighth-largest city\\n, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\\nThe\\nPittsburgh Agreement\\nwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by\\nT. G. Masaryk\\n, concerning the future foundation of\\nCzechoslovakia\\n.\\nThe city suffered\\nsevere flooding\\nin March 1936.\\nThe city\\'s population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city\\'s population.\\nPittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American\\nGreat Migration\\nfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.\\nLimited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\\nDuring\\nWorld War II\\n, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\\xa0million tons of steel for the war effort.\\nThis resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city\\'s almost century of industry. The city\\'s reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"\\nwas being overshadowed by\\nJames Parton\\n\\'s 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area\\'s steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city\\'s population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\\n21st century\\nDuring the\\nlate 2000s recession\\n, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the\\nPittsburgh\\nmetropolitan statistical area\\n(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\\nIn September 2009, the\\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\\nwas held in Pittsburgh.\\nGeography\\nSee also:\\nPittsburgh metropolitan area §\\xa0Regional identity\\nThe\\nDuquesne Incline\\nfrom\\nMount Washington\\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\\xa0km\\n2\\n), of which 55.6 square miles (144\\xa0km\\n2\\n) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\\xa0km\\n2\\n), or 4.75%, is water.

In the 1950s, the Lower\\nHill District\\nunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the\\nCivic Arena\\n, which opened in 1961.\\nThis project, part of Pittsburgh\\'s revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood\\'s population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.\\nIn the 1960s, the\\nUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh\\n(URA) aimed to revitalize\\nEast Liberty\\n, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.\\nBy the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like\\nHome Depot\\n, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.\\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government\\'s actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate\\ngentrification\\nof neighborhoods.\\nThe demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.\\nReligion\\nReligion in Pittsburgh (2014)\\nReligion\\nPercent\\nProtestantism\\n42%\\nCatholicism\\n32%\\nOther\\nChristian\\n3%\\nNo religion\\n18%\\nOthers\\n4%\\nDon\\'t know\\n1%\\nAccording to a 2014 study by the\\nPew Research Center\\n, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered\\nProtestant\\n, and 32% professing\\nCatholic\\nbeliefs. 18% claimed no religious affiliation.

According to\\nGeorge Croghan\\n, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington\\'s Landing, formerly\\nHerr\\'s Island\\n, in what is now the\\nLawrenceville\\nneighborhood.\\n18th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Revolution\\nFort Pitt Block House\\n, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer\\nRobert de La Salle\\nfrom\\nQuebec\\nduring his 1669 expedition down the\\nOhio River\\n.\\n[\\nbetter\\xa0source\\xa0needed\\n]\\nEuropean pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European\\nfur traders\\nestablished area posts and settlements.\\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite\\nCanada\\nwith\\nFrench Louisiana\\nvia the rivers.\\nDuring 1753–1754, the British hastily built\\nFort Prince George\\nbefore a larger French force drove them off. The French built\\nFort Duquesne\\nbased on LaSalle\\'s 1669 claims. The\\nFrench and Indian War\\n, the North American front of the\\nSeven Years\\' War\\n, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General\\nEdward Braddock\\nwas dispatched with Major\\nGeorge Washington\\nas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.\\nThe British and colonial force were defeated at\\nBraddock\\'s Field\\n. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on\\nFort Pitt\\n, named after\\nWilliam Pitt the Elder\\n, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\\nDuring\\nPontiac\\'s War\\n, a loose confederation of Native American tribes\\nlaid siege to Fort Pitt\\nin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel\\nHenry Bouquet\\ndefeated a portion of the besieging force at the\\nBattle of Bushy Run\\n. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the\\nIroquois Confederacy\\n, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768\\nTreaty of Fort Stanwix\\n, the\\nPenns\\nwere allowed to purchase the modern region from the\\nIroquois\\n. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".\\nBoth the\\nColony of Virginia\\nand the\\nProvince of Pennsylvania\\nclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the\\nMason–Dixon line\\nwestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,\\nBedford County, Pennsylvania\\nwas created to govern the frontier.\\nOn April 16, 1771, the city\\'s first civilian local government was created as\\nPitt Township\\n.\\nWilliam Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\\nFollowing the\\nAmerican Revolution\\n, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the\\nOhio Country\\n. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the\\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\\nwas started, and in 1787, the\\nPittsburgh Academy\\nwas chartered. Unrest during the\\nWhiskey Rebellion\\nof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the\\nAppalachian Mountains\\nor through the\\nGreat Lakes\\n.\\nFort Pitt\\n(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the\\nNorthwest Territory\\n.\\n19th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Civil War\\nThe\\nMonongahela River\\nand its surroundings in 1857\\nLithograph\\nof Pittsburgh by\\nOtto Krebs\\n(before 1874)\\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the\\nLewis and Clark Expedition\\n.\\nPreparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when\\nMeriwether Lewis\\npurchased a\\nkeelboat\\nthat would later be used to ascend the\\nMissouri River\\n.\\nThe\\nWar of 1812\\ncut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\\nIn the 1830s, many\\nWelsh people\\nfrom the\\nMerthyr\\nsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the\\nMerthyr Rising\\n. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the\\nAllegheny Mountains\\n. The\\nGreat Fire of Pittsburgh\\ndestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the\\nGreat Famine\\n. By 1857, Pittsburgh\\'s 1,000 factories were consuming 22\\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from\\nGermany\\n.\\nBurning of Union Depot during the\\nPittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the\\nUnderground Railroad\\nin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.\\nThe Merchant\\'s Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.\\nSometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850\\nFugitive Slave Act\\n, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\\nThe\\nAmerican Civil War\\nboosted the city\\'s economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.\\nAndrew Carnegie\\nbegan steel production in 1875 at the\\nEdgar Thomson Steel Works\\nin\\nNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania\\n, which evolved into the\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\n. He adopted the\\nBessemer process\\nto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\\n20th century\\nAn aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902\\nSteel mills in the\\nStrip District\\nin 1906\\nIn 1901,\\nJ. P. Morgan\\nand attorney\\nElbert H. Gary\\nmerged\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\nand several other companies into\\nU.S. Steel\\n. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the\\nnation\\'s eighth-largest city\\n, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\\nThe\\nPittsburgh Agreement\\nwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by\\nT. G. Masaryk\\n, concerning the future foundation of\\nCzechoslovakia\\n.\\nThe city suffered\\nsevere flooding\\nin March 1936.\\nThe city\\'s population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city\\'s population.\\nPittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American\\nGreat Migration\\nfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.\\nLimited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\\nDuring\\nWorld War II\\n, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\\xa0million tons of steel for the war effort.\\nThis resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city\\'s almost century of industry. The city\\'s reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"\\nwas being overshadowed by\\nJames Parton\\n\\'s 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area\\'s steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city\\'s population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\\n21st century\\nDuring the\\nlate 2000s recession\\n, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the\\nPittsburgh\\nmetropolitan statistical area\\n(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\\nIn September 2009, the\\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\\nwas held in Pittsburgh.\\nGeography\\nSee also:\\nPittsburgh metropolitan area §\\xa0Regional identity\\nThe\\nDuquesne Incline\\nfrom\\nMount Washington\\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\\xa0km\\n2\\n), of which 55.6 square miles (144\\xa0km\\n2\\n) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\\xa0km\\n2\\n), or 4.75%, is water.

In the 1950s, the Lower\\nHill District\\nunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the\\nCivic Arena\\n, which opened in 1961.\\nThis project, part of Pittsburgh\\'s revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood\\'s population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.\\nIn the 1960s, the\\nUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh\\n(URA) aimed to revitalize\\nEast Liberty\\n, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.\\nBy the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like\\nHome Depot\\n, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.\\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government\\'s actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate\\ngentrification\\nof neighborhoods.\\nThe demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.\\nReligion\\nReligion in Pittsburgh (2014)\\nReligion\\nPercent\\nProtestantism\\n42%\\nCatholicism\\n32%\\nOther\\nChristian\\n3%\\nNo religion\\n18%\\nOthers\\n4%\\nDon\\'t know\\n1%\\nAccording to a 2014 study by the\\nPew Research Center\\n, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered\\nProtestant\\n, and 32% professing\\nCatholic\\nbeliefs. 18% claimed no religious affiliation.

Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world\\'s largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.\\n\"My heart is in the work,\" he stated, which would become part of the school\\'s official motto.\\nAt one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie once said, \"To die rich is to die disgraced.\" He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed.\\nCMU\\'s Origin\\n1900: Initial Funding for Carnegie Technical Schools\\nIn 1900, Andrew Carnegie donated $1 million to the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities.\\nThe Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.\\nInitial number of students\\nThe first Carnegie Technical Schools class was admitted in 1906.\\nDegrees Introduced\\n1912: Carnegie Tech Grants Bachelor\\'s Degrees\\nSoon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools changed its name to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or \"Carnegie Tech\", and began offering bachelor\\'s degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts.\\nCarnegie Tech set the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China.\\nFirst U.S. Drama Class\\nactors\\nThe first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech.\\nInvestment in Expansion\\nEarly 20th Century Progress\\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th-century campus designed in the Beaux Arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today.\\nCarnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.\\nHumanities Requirement\\n% of curriculum\\nWith the goal of understanding societal needs, the Carnegie Plan began in 1938. Science and engineering students were now required to take humanities and social sciences courses.\\nPost-war Growth: Opening Three New Schools\\nWith the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study.\\nUniversity culture also changed in 1973, when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms.\\n1948\\nThe Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the\\nDavid A. Tepper School of Business\\n, focused on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science.\\n1968\\nThe School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the\\nH. John Heinz III College\\n, provided graduate training for work in the public sector.\\n1986\\nThe\\nSchool of Computer Science\\npioneered computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon.\\n1967 - Present\\nThe CMU of Today\\nIn 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as\\nCarnegie Mellon University\\n.\\nThis support from the Mellons allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as the\\nMarianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences\\n.\\nIn 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech–Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.\\n2025 Student Count\\nCMU\\'s Global Leadership\\nIn its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists.\\nIn the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh.\\nToday its global presence includes campuses in\\nQatar\\nand\\nSilicon Valley, Calif.\\n, more than a dozen degree-granting locations, and more than 20 research partnerships in cities and countries such as\\nLos Angeles\\n,\\nNew York City\\n,\\nWashington, D.C.\\n,\\nChina\\n,\\nPortugal\\nand\\nRwanda\\n.\\n2002\\nCarnegie Mellon established a\\nbranch campus in Silicon Valley\\n, the epicenter of the modern technological revolution.\\n2004\\nCarnegie University in Qatar (CMU-Q)\\nopened its doors with 41 students, offering programs in Business Administration and Computer Science.\\n2011\\nCarnegie Mellon University and the Government of Rwanda signed an agreement to establish\\nCMU-Africa\\n. This partnership was designed to respond to the critical shortage of high-quality engineering talent required to harness Africa\\'s tremendous potential as home to the fastest-growing workforce in the world.\\nExpanding into the Future\\nCMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900.\\nAt the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.\\nExplore our Strategic Framework 2025', 'https://community.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/EventSearch': 'Big Bad Scary\\nSat., Oct. 18, 8-11 p.m.\\nFreedom SOI (Sons of Italy)\\nAmbridge\\nClassic Rock\\nBig Bad Scary at the Freedom SOI - open to the public for the show!!! — playing 70s 80s 90s and current rock!!!\\nHauntings, Legends & Gallery Readings: An Evening with the Psychic Vincent Sisters\\nSat., Oct. 25, 4-8 p.m.\\nBottlebrush Gallery & Shop\\nHarmony\\nHoliday\\n,\\nFestivals\\n,\\nFood & Drink Event\\nJoin us for an evening of hauntings, legends and psychic readings by the internationally known Psychic Vincent Sisters as part of our famously spirited town\\'s adult celebration, \"Haunted Harmony\".

As Forbes was a\\nScotsman\\n, he probably pronounced the name\\n/\\nˈ\\np\\nɪ\\nt\\ns\\nb\\nər\\nə\\n/\\nPITS\\n-bər-ə\\n(similar to\\nEdinburgh\\n).\\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a\\nborough\\non April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\\n\"Be it enacted by the\\nPennsylvania State Senate\\nand\\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"\\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city\\'s name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final\\nh\\nwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.\\nAfter a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the\\nh\\nwas reversed.\\nThe\\nPittsburg Press\\ncontinued spelling the city without an\\nh\\nuntil 1921.\\nHistory\\nMain article:\\nHistory of Pittsburgh\\nFor a chronological guide, see\\nTimeline of Pittsburgh\\n.\\nHistorical claims\\nKingdom of France\\n1690s–1763\\nGreat Britain\\n1681–1781\\nUnited States\\n1776–present\\nNative Americans\\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the\\nShawnee\\nand several other settled groups of\\nNative Americans\\n.\\nShannopin\\'s Town\\nwas an 18th-century\\nLenape\\n(Delaware) town located roughly from where\\nPenn Avenue\\nis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to\\nGeorge Croghan\\n, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington\\'s Landing, formerly\\nHerr\\'s Island\\n, in what is now the\\nLawrenceville\\nneighborhood.\\n18th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Revolution\\nFort Pitt Block House\\n, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer\\nRobert de La Salle\\nfrom\\nQuebec\\nduring his 1669 expedition down the\\nOhio River\\n.\\n[\\nbetter\\xa0source\\xa0needed\\n]\\nEuropean pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European\\nfur traders\\nestablished area posts and settlements.\\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite\\nCanada\\nwith\\nFrench Louisiana\\nvia the rivers.\\nDuring 1753–1754, the British hastily built\\nFort Prince George\\nbefore a larger French force drove them off. The French built\\nFort Duquesne\\nbased on LaSalle\\'s 1669 claims. The\\nFrench and Indian War\\n, the North American front of the\\nSeven Years\\' War\\n, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General\\nEdward Braddock\\nwas dispatched with Major\\nGeorge Washington\\nas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.\\nThe British and colonial force were defeated at\\nBraddock\\'s Field\\n. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on\\nFort Pitt\\n, named after\\nWilliam Pitt the Elder\\n, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\\nDuring\\nPontiac\\'s War\\n, a loose confederation of Native American tribes\\nlaid siege to Fort Pitt\\nin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel\\nHenry Bouquet\\ndefeated a portion of the besieging force at the\\nBattle of Bushy Run\\n. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the\\nIroquois Confederacy\\n, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768\\nTreaty of Fort Stanwix\\n, the\\nPenns\\nwere allowed to purchase the modern region from the\\nIroquois\\n. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".\\nBoth the\\nColony of Virginia\\nand the\\nProvince of Pennsylvania\\nclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the\\nMason–Dixon line\\nwestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,\\nBedford County, Pennsylvania\\nwas created to govern the frontier.\\nOn April 16, 1771, the city\\'s first civilian local government was created as\\nPitt Township\\n.\\nWilliam Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\\nFollowing the\\nAmerican Revolution\\n, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the\\nOhio Country\\n. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the\\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\\nwas started, and in 1787, the\\nPittsburgh Academy\\nwas chartered. Unrest during the\\nWhiskey Rebellion\\nof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the\\nAppalachian Mountains\\nor through the\\nGreat Lakes\\n.\\nFort Pitt\\n(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the\\nNorthwest Territory\\n.\\n19th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Civil War\\nThe\\nMonongahela River\\nand its surroundings in 1857\\nLithograph\\nof Pittsburgh by\\nOtto Krebs\\n(before 1874)\\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the\\nLewis and Clark Expedition\\n.\\nPreparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when\\nMeriwether Lewis\\npurchased a\\nkeelboat\\nthat would later be used to ascend the\\nMissouri River\\n.\\nThe\\nWar of 1812\\ncut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\\nIn the 1830s, many\\nWelsh people\\nfrom the\\nMerthyr\\nsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the\\nMerthyr Rising\\n. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the\\nAllegheny Mountains\\n. The\\nGreat Fire of Pittsburgh\\ndestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the\\nGreat Famine\\n. By 1857, Pittsburgh\\'s 1,000 factories were consuming 22\\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from\\nGermany\\n.\\nBurning of Union Depot during the\\nPittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the\\nUnderground Railroad\\nin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.\\nThe Merchant\\'s Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.\\nSometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850\\nFugitive Slave Act\\n, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\\nThe\\nAmerican Civil War\\nboosted the city\\'s economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.\\nAndrew Carnegie\\nbegan steel production in 1875 at the\\nEdgar Thomson Steel Works\\nin\\nNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania\\n, which evolved into the\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\n. He adopted the\\nBessemer process\\nto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\\n20th century\\nAn aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902\\nSteel mills in the\\nStrip District\\nin 1906\\nIn 1901,\\nJ. P. Morgan\\nand attorney\\nElbert H. Gary\\nmerged\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\nand several other companies into\\nU.S. Steel\\n. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the\\nnation\\'s eighth-largest city\\n, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\\nThe\\nPittsburgh Agreement\\nwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by\\nT. G. Masaryk\\n, concerning the future foundation of\\nCzechoslovakia\\n.\\nThe city suffered\\nsevere flooding\\nin March 1936.\\nThe city\\'s population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city\\'s population.\\nPittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American\\nGreat Migration\\nfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.\\nLimited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\\nDuring\\nWorld War II\\n, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\\xa0million tons of steel for the war effort.\\nThis resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city\\'s almost century of industry. The city\\'s reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"\\nwas being overshadowed by\\nJames Parton\\n\\'s 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area\\'s steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city\\'s population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\\n21st century\\nDuring the\\nlate 2000s recession\\n, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the\\nPittsburgh\\nmetropolitan statistical area\\n(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\\nIn September 2009, the\\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\\nwas held in Pittsburgh.\\nGeography\\nSee also:\\nPittsburgh metropolitan area §\\xa0Regional identity\\nThe\\nDuquesne Incline\\nfrom\\nMount Washington\\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\\xa0km\\n2\\n), of which 55.6 square miles (144\\xa0km\\n2\\n) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\\xa0km\\n2\\n), or 4.75%, is water.

In the 1950s, the Lower\\nHill District\\nunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the\\nCivic Arena\\n, which opened in 1961.\\nThis project, part of Pittsburgh\\'s revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood\\'s population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.\\nIn the 1960s, the\\nUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh\\n(URA) aimed to revitalize\\nEast Liberty\\n, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.\\nBy the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like\\nHome Depot\\n, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.\\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government\\'s actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate\\ngentrification\\nof neighborhoods.\\nThe demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.\\nReligion\\nReligion in Pittsburgh (2014)\\nReligion\\nPercent\\nProtestantism\\n42%\\nCatholicism\\n32%\\nOther\\nChristian\\n3%\\nNo religion\\n18%\\nOthers\\n4%\\nDon\\'t know\\n1%\\nAccording to a 2014 study by the\\nPew Research Center\\n, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered\\nProtestant\\n, and 32% professing\\nCatholic\\nbeliefs. 18% claimed no religious affiliation.

As Forbes was a\\nScotsman\\n, he probably pronounced the name\\n/\\nˈ\\np\\nɪ\\nt\\ns\\nb\\nər\\nə\\n/\\nPITS\\n-bər-ə\\n(similar to\\nEdinburgh\\n).\\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a\\nborough\\non April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\\n\"Be it enacted by the\\nPennsylvania State Senate\\nand\\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"\\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city\\'s name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final\\nh\\nwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.\\nAfter a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the\\nh\\nwas reversed.\\nThe\\nPittsburg Press\\ncontinued spelling the city without an\\nh\\nuntil 1921.\\nHistory\\nMain article:\\nHistory of Pittsburgh\\nFor a chronological guide, see\\nTimeline of Pittsburgh\\n.\\nHistorical claims\\nKingdom of France\\n1690s–1763\\nGreat Britain\\n1681–1781\\nUnited States\\n1776–present\\nNative Americans\\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the\\nShawnee\\nand several other settled groups of\\nNative Americans\\n.\\nShannopin\\'s Town\\nwas an 18th-century\\nLenape\\n(Delaware) town located roughly from where\\nPenn Avenue\\nis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to\\nGeorge Croghan\\n, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington\\'s Landing, formerly\\nHerr\\'s Island\\n, in what is now the\\nLawrenceville\\nneighborhood.\\n18th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Revolution\\nFort Pitt Block House\\n, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer\\nRobert de La Salle\\nfrom\\nQuebec\\nduring his 1669 expedition down the\\nOhio River\\n.\\n[\\nbetter\\xa0source\\xa0needed\\n]\\nEuropean pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European\\nfur traders\\nestablished area posts and settlements.\\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite\\nCanada\\nwith\\nFrench Louisiana\\nvia the rivers.\\nDuring 1753–1754, the British hastily built\\nFort Prince George\\nbefore a larger French force drove them off. The French built\\nFort Duquesne\\nbased on LaSalle\\'s 1669 claims. The\\nFrench and Indian War\\n, the North American front of the\\nSeven Years\\' War\\n, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General\\nEdward Braddock\\nwas dispatched with Major\\nGeorge Washington\\nas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.\\nThe British and colonial force were defeated at\\nBraddock\\'s Field\\n. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on\\nFort Pitt\\n, named after\\nWilliam Pitt the Elder\\n, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\\nDuring\\nPontiac\\'s War\\n, a loose confederation of Native American tribes\\nlaid siege to Fort Pitt\\nin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel\\nHenry Bouquet\\ndefeated a portion of the besieging force at the\\nBattle of Bushy Run\\n. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the\\nIroquois Confederacy\\n, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768\\nTreaty of Fort Stanwix\\n, the\\nPenns\\nwere allowed to purchase the modern region from the\\nIroquois\\n. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".\\nBoth the\\nColony of Virginia\\nand the\\nProvince of Pennsylvania\\nclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the\\nMason–Dixon line\\nwestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,\\nBedford County, Pennsylvania\\nwas created to govern the frontier.\\nOn April 16, 1771, the city\\'s first civilian local government was created as\\nPitt Township\\n.\\nWilliam Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\\nFollowing the\\nAmerican Revolution\\n, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the\\nOhio Country\\n. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the\\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\\nwas started, and in 1787, the\\nPittsburgh Academy\\nwas chartered. Unrest during the\\nWhiskey Rebellion\\nof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the\\nAppalachian Mountains\\nor through the\\nGreat Lakes\\n.\\nFort Pitt\\n(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the\\nNorthwest Territory\\n.\\n19th century\\nFurther information:\\nPennsylvania in the American Civil War\\nThe\\nMonongahela River\\nand its surroundings in 1857\\nLithograph\\nof Pittsburgh by\\nOtto Krebs\\n(before 1874)\\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the\\nLewis and Clark Expedition\\n.\\nPreparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when\\nMeriwether Lewis\\npurchased a\\nkeelboat\\nthat would later be used to ascend the\\nMissouri River\\n.\\nThe\\nWar of 1812\\ncut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\\nIn the 1830s, many\\nWelsh people\\nfrom the\\nMerthyr\\nsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the\\nMerthyr Rising\\n. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the\\nAllegheny Mountains\\n. The\\nGreat Fire of Pittsburgh\\ndestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the\\nGreat Famine\\n. By 1857, Pittsburgh\\'s 1,000 factories were consuming 22\\xa0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from\\nGermany\\n.\\nBurning of Union Depot during the\\nPittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the\\nUnderground Railroad\\nin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.\\nThe Merchant\\'s Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.\\nSometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850\\nFugitive Slave Act\\n, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\\nThe\\nAmerican Civil War\\nboosted the city\\'s economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.\\nAndrew Carnegie\\nbegan steel production in 1875 at the\\nEdgar Thomson Steel Works\\nin\\nNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania\\n, which evolved into the\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\n. He adopted the\\nBessemer process\\nto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\\n20th century\\nAn aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902\\nSteel mills in the\\nStrip District\\nin 1906\\nIn 1901,\\nJ. P. Morgan\\nand attorney\\nElbert H. Gary\\nmerged\\nCarnegie Steel Company\\nand several other companies into\\nU.S. Steel\\n. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the\\nnation\\'s eighth-largest city\\n, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\\nThe\\nPittsburgh Agreement\\nwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by\\nT. G. Masaryk\\n, concerning the future foundation of\\nCzechoslovakia\\n.\\nThe city suffered\\nsevere flooding\\nin March 1936.\\nThe city\\'s population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city\\'s population.\\nPittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American\\nGreat Migration\\nfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.\\nLimited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\\nDuring\\nWorld War II\\n, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\\xa0million tons of steel for the war effort.\\nThis resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city\\'s almost century of industry. The city\\'s reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"\\nwas being overshadowed by\\nJames Parton\\n\\'s 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area\\'s steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city\\'s population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\\n21st century\\nDuring the\\nlate 2000s recession\\n, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the\\nPittsburgh\\nmetropolitan statistical area\\n(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\\nIn September 2009, the\\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\\nwas held in Pittsburgh.\\nGeography\\nSee also:\\nPittsburgh metropolitan area §\\xa0Regional identity\\nThe\\nDuquesne Incline\\nfrom\\nMount Washington\\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\\xa0km\\n2\\n), of which 55.6 square miles (144\\xa0km\\n2\\n) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\\xa0km\\n2\\n), or 4.75%, is water.

In the 1950s, the Lower\\nHill District\\nunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the\\nCivic Arena\\n, which opened in 1961.\\nThis project, part of Pittsburgh\\'s revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood\\'s population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.\\nIn the 1960s, the\\nUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh\\n(URA) aimed to revitalize\\nEast Liberty\\n, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.\\nBy the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like\\nHome Depot\\n, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.\\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government\\'s actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate\\ngentrification\\nof neighborhoods.\\nThe demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.\\nReligion\\nReligion in Pittsburgh (2014)\\nReligion\\nPercent\\nProtestantism\\n42%\\nCatholicism\\n32%\\nOther\\nChristian\\n3%\\nNo religion\\n18%\\nOthers\\n4%\\nDon\\'t know\\n1%\\nAccording to a 2014 study by the\\nPew Research Center\\n, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered\\nProtestant\\n, and 32% professing\\nCatholic\\nbeliefs. 18% claimed no religious affiliation.

He rose to prominence by founding what became the world\\'s largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.\\n\"My heart is in the work,\" he stated, which would become part of the school\\'s official motto.\\nAt one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie once said, \"To die rich is to die disgraced.\" He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed.\\nCMU\\'s Origin\\n1900: Initial Funding for Carnegie Technical Schools\\nIn 1900, Andrew Carnegie donated $1 million to the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities.\\nThe Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.\\nInitial number of students\\nThe first Carnegie Technical Schools class was admitted in 1906.\\nDegrees Introduced\\n1912: Carnegie Tech Grants Bachelor\\'s Degrees\\nSoon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools changed its name to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or \"Carnegie Tech\", and began offering bachelor\\'s degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts.\\nCarnegie Tech set the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China.\\nFirst U.S. Drama Class\\nactors\\nThe first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech.\\nInvestment in Expansion\\nEarly 20th Century Progress\\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th-century campus designed in the Beaux Arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories — the hands-on center of learning that persists today.\\nCarnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.\\nHumanities Requirement\\n% of curriculum\\nWith the goal of understanding societal needs, the Carnegie Plan began in 1938. Science and engineering students were now required to take humanities and social sciences courses.\\nPost-war Growth: Opening Three New Schools\\nWith the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study.\\nUniversity culture also changed in 1973, when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms.\\n1948\\nThe Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the\\nDavid A. Tepper School of Business\\n, focused on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science.\\n1968\\nThe School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the\\nH. John Heinz III College\\n, provided graduate training for work in the public sector.\\n1986\\nThe\\nSchool of Computer Science\\npioneered computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon.\\n1967 - Present\\nThe CMU of Today\\nIn 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as\\nCarnegie Mellon University\\n.\\nThis support from the Mellons allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as the\\nMarianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences\\n.\\nIn 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech–Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.\\n2025 Student Count\\nCMU\\'s Global Leadership\\nIn its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe — from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists.\\nIn the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh.\\nToday its global presence includes campuses in\\nQatar\\nand\\nSilicon Valley, Calif.\\n, more than a dozen degree-granting locations, and more than 20 research partnerships in cities and countries such as\\nLos Angeles\\n,\\nNew York City\\n,\\nWashington, D.C.\\n,\\nChina\\n,\\nPortugal\\nand\\nRwanda\\n.\\n2002\\nCarnegie Mellon established a\\nbranch campus in Silicon Valley\\n, the epicenter of the modern technological revolution.\\n2004\\nCarnegie University in Qatar (CMU-Q)\\nopened its doors with 41 students, offering programs in Business Administration and Computer Science.\\n2011\\nCarnegie Mellon University and the Government of Rwanda signed an agreement to establish\\nCMU-Africa\\n. This partnership was designed to respond to the critical shortage of high-quality engineering talent required to harness Africa\\'s tremendous potential as home to the fastest-growing workforce in the world.\\nExpanding into the Future\\nCMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900.\\nAt the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.\\nExplore our Strategic Framework 2025', 'https://community.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/EventSearch': 'Big Bad Scary\\nSat., Oct. 18, 8-11 p.m.\\nFreedom SOI (Sons of Italy)\\nAmbridge\\nClassic Rock\\nBig Bad Scary at the Freedom SOI - open to the public for the show!!! — playing 70s 80s 90s and current rock!!!\\nHauntings, Legends & Gallery Readings: An Evening with the Psychic Vincent Sisters\\nSat., Oct. 25, 4-8 p.m.\\nBottlebrush Gallery & Shop\\nHarmony\\nHoliday\\n,\\nFestivals\\n,\\nFood & Drink Event\\nJoin us for an evening of hauntings, legends and psychic readings by the internationally known Psychic Vincent Sisters as part of our famously spirited town\\'s adult celebration, \"Haunted Harmony\".
