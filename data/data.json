The city is located in\nsouthwestern Pennsylvania\nat the confluence of the\nAllegheny River\nand\nMonongahela River\n, which combine to form the\nOhio River\n.\nIt is the\nsecond-most populous city in Pennsylvania\n, with a population of 302,971 at the\n2020 census\n. The\nPittsburgh metropolitan area\n, at over 2.43 million residents, is the largest metropolitan area in both the\nOhio Valley\nand\nAppalachia\n, the\nsecond-largest in Pennsylvania\n, and\n28th-largest in the U.S.\nThe greater\nPittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area\nincludes parts of\nOhio\nand\nWest Virginia\n.\nPittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the\nhistory of the U.S. steel industry\n.\nIt developed as a vital link of the\nAtlantic coast\nand\nMidwest\n, as the mineral-rich\nAllegheny Mountains\nled to the region being contested by the\nFrench\nand\nBritish\nempires,\nVirginians\n,\nWhiskey Rebels\n, and\nCivil War raiders\n.\nFor part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only\nNew York City\nand\nChicago\nin corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.\nDeindustrialization\nin the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among\nblue-collar workers\nas steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.\nHowever, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\nand\nAllegheny Health Network\n, as well as\n68 colleges and universities\n, including\nCarnegie Mellon University\nand the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n.\nThe area has served as the federal agency headquarters for\ncyber defense\n,\nsoftware engineering\n,\nrobotics\n,\nenergy research\n, and the\nnuclear navy\n.\nThe city is home to ten\nFortune 500\ncompanies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms.\nPittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its\n446 bridges\n.\nIts rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the\nCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh\n,\nPittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium\n,\nPhipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens\n, the\nNational Aviary\n, and a diverse\ncultural district\n.\nThe city's major league\nprofessional sports teams\ninclude the\nPittsburgh Steelers\n,\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, and\nPittsburgh Pirates\n. Pittsburgh is additionally where\nJehovah's Witnesses\ntraces its earliest origins, and was the host of the\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\n.\nEtymology\nMain article:\nName of Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General\nJohn Forbes\n, in honor of British statesman\nWilliam Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham\n. As Forbes was a\nScotsman\n, he probably pronounced the name\n/\n\u02c8\np\n\u026a\nt\ns\nb\n\u0259r\n\u0259\n/\nPITS\n-b\u0259r-\u0259\n(similar to\nEdinburgh\n).\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a\nborough\non April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\n\"Be it enacted by the\nPennsylvania State Senate\nand\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final\nh\nwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.\nAfter a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the\nh\nwas reversed.\nThe\nPittsburg Press\ncontinued spelling the city without an\nh\nuntil 1921.\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of Pittsburgh\nFor a chronological guide, see\nTimeline of Pittsburgh\n.\nHistorical claims\nKingdom of France\n1690s\u20131763\nGreat Britain\n1681\u20131781\nUnited States\n1776\u2013present\nNative Americans\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the\nShawnee\nand several other settled groups of\nNative Americans\n.\nShannopin's Town\nwas an 18th-century\nLenape\n(Delaware) town located roughly from where\nPenn Avenue\nis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to\nGeorge Croghan\n, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly\nHerr's Island\n, in what is now the\nLawrenceville\nneighborhood.\n18th century\nFurther information:\nPennsylvania in the American Revolution\nFort Pitt Block House\n, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer\nRobert de La Salle\nfrom\nQuebec\nduring his 1669 expedition down the\nOhio River\n.\n[\nbetter\u00a0source\u00a0needed\n]\nEuropean pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European\nfur traders\nestablished area posts and settlements.\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite\nCanada\nwith\nFrench Louisiana\nvia the rivers.\nDuring 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built\nFort Prince George\nbefore a larger French force drove them off. The French built\nFort Duquesne\nbased on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The\nFrench and Indian War\n, the North American front of the\nSeven Years' War\n, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General\nEdward Braddock\nwas dispatched with Major\nGeorge Washington\nas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.\nThe British and colonial force were defeated at\nBraddock's Field\n. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on\nFort Pitt\n, named after\nWilliam Pitt the Elder\n, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\nDuring\nPontiac's War\n, a loose confederation of Native American tribes\nlaid siege to Fort Pitt\nin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel\nHenry Bouquet\ndefeated a portion of the besieging force at the\nBattle of Bushy Run\n. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the\nIroquois Confederacy\n, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768\nTreaty of Fort Stanwix\n, the\nPenns\nwere allowed to purchase the modern region from the\nIroquois\n. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".\nBoth the\nColony of Virginia\nand the\nProvince of Pennsylvania\nclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the\nMason\u2013Dixon line\nwestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,\nBedford County, Pennsylvania\nwas created to govern the frontier.\nOn April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as\nPitt Township\n.\nWilliam Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\nFollowing the\nAmerican Revolution\n, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the\nOhio Country\n. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\nwas started, and in 1787, the\nPittsburgh Academy\nwas chartered. Unrest during the\nWhiskey Rebellion\nof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the\nAppalachian Mountains\nor through the\nGreat Lakes\n.\nFort Pitt\n(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the\nNorthwest Territory\n.\n19th century\nFurther information:\nPennsylvania in the American Civil War\nThe\nMonongahela River\nand its surroundings in 1857\nLithograph\nof Pittsburgh by\nOtto Krebs\n(before 1874)\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the\nLewis and Clark Expedition\n.\nPreparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when\nMeriwether Lewis\npurchased a\nkeelboat\nthat would later be used to ascend the\nMissouri River\n.\nThe\nWar of 1812\ncut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\nIn the 1830s, many\nWelsh people\nfrom the\nMerthyr\nsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the\nMerthyr Rising\n. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the\nAllegheny Mountains\n. The\nGreat Fire of Pittsburgh\ndestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the\nGreat Famine\n. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from\nGermany\n.\nBurning of Union Depot during the\nPittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the\nUnderground Railroad\nin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.\nThe Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.\nSometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850\nFugitive Slave Act\n, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\nThe\nAmerican Civil War\nboosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.\nAndrew Carnegie\nbegan steel production in 1875 at the\nEdgar Thomson Steel Works\nin\nNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania\n, which evolved into the\nCarnegie Steel Company\n. He adopted the\nBessemer process\nto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n20th century\nAn aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902\nSteel mills in the\nStrip District\nin 1906\nIn 1901,\nJ. P. Morgan\nand attorney\nElbert H. Gary\nmerged\nCarnegie Steel Company\nand several other companies into\nU.S. Steel\n. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the\nnation's eighth-largest city\n, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\nThe\nPittsburgh Agreement\nwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by\nT. G. Masaryk\n, concerning the future foundation of\nCzechoslovakia\n.\nThe city suffered\nsevere flooding\nin March 1936.\nThe city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.\nPittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American\nGreat Migration\nfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.\nLimited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\nDuring\nWorld War II\n, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\u00a0million tons of steel for the war effort.\nThis resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"\nwas being overshadowed by\nJames Parton\n's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n21st century\nDuring the\nlate 2000s recession\n, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the\nPittsburgh\nmetropolitan statistical area\n(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\nIn September 2009, the\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\nwas held in Pittsburgh.\nGeography\nSee also:\nPittsburgh metropolitan area \u00a7\u00a0Regional identity\nThe\nDuquesne Incline\nfrom\nMount Washington\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\u00a0km\n2\n), of which 55.6 square miles (144\u00a0km\n2\n) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\u00a0km\n2\n), or 4.75%, is water.

The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.\nMany\nPittsburgh neighborhoods\nare steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.\nThe\nsteps of Pittsburgh\nconsist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.\nMany provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.\nBike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The\nGreat Allegheny Passage\nand\nChesapeake and Ohio Canal\nTowpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539\u00a0km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\nCityscape\nMain articles:\nDowntown Pittsburgh\n,\nNorth Side (Pittsburgh)\n,\nSouth Side (Pittsburgh)\n, and\nWest End (Pittsburgh)\nSee also:\nList of Pittsburgh neighborhoods\n,\nList of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh\n,\nList of City of Pittsburgh historic designations\n, and\nList of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks\nPittsburgh's\n90 distinct neighborhoods\nEast Carson Street in the\nSouth Side Flats\nShadyside\nneighborhood\nThe city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,\nand four main areas surrounding it\u2014Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.

The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121.8\u00a0\u00b0C), and lows of 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.\nOfficially, record temperatures range from \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230\u00a0\u00b0C), on\nJanuary 19, 1994\nto 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is \u22123\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221219\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 1, 1901.\nDue to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.\nAverage annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006\u00a0mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65\u00a0in (575\u00a0mm) in 1930 to 57.83\u00a0in (1,469\u00a0mm) in 2018.\nOn average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112\u00a0cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8\u00a0in (22\u00a0cm) in 1918\u201319 to 80\u00a0in (200\u00a0cm) in 1950\u201351.\nThere is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.\nIn terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to\nSeattle\n(49%).\nClimate data for Pittsburgh (\nPittsburgh International Airport\n), 1991\u20132020 normals,\nextremes 1874\u2013present\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\nYear\nRecord high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n75\n(24)\n78\n(26)\n84\n(29)\n90\n(32)\n95\n(35)\n98\n(37)\n103\n(39)\n103\n(39)\n102\n(39)\n91\n(33)\n82\n(28)\n74\n(23)\n103\n(39)\nMean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n61.5\n(16.4)\n63.2\n(17.3)\n73.5\n(23.1)\n81.5\n(27.5)\n86.8\n(30.4)\n90.4\n(32.4)\n91.3\n(32.9)\n90.3\n(32.4)\n88.2\n(31.2)\n79.9\n(26.6)\n70.8\n(21.6)\n62.6\n(17.0)\n92.6\n(33.7)\nMean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n36.3\n(2.4)\n39.6\n(4.2)\n49.1\n(9.5)\n62.4\n(16.9)\n71.9\n(22.2)\n79.4\n(26.3)\n82.9\n(28.3)\n81.7\n(27.6)\n75.1\n(23.9)\n63.1\n(17.3)\n50.9\n(10.5)\n40.6\n(4.8)\n61.1\n(16.2)\nDaily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n28.8\n(\u22121.8)\n31.4\n(\u22120.3)\n39.7\n(4.3)\n51.5\n(10.8)\n61.2\n(16.2)\n69.4\n(20.8)\n73.2\n(22.9)\n71.8\n(22.1)\n64.9\n(18.3)\n53.4\n(11.9)\n42.6\n(5.9)\n33.7\n(0.9)\n51.8\n(11.0)\nMean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n21.4\n(\u22125.9)\n23.2\n(\u22124.9)\n30.3\n(\u22120.9)\n40.7\n(4.8)\n50.6\n(10.3)\n59.3\n(15.2)\n63.4\n(17.4)\n62.0\n(16.7)\n54.8\n(12.7)\n43.7\n(6.5)\n34.3\n(1.3)\n26.7\n(\u22122.9)\n42.5\n(5.8)\nMean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n1.0\n(\u221217.2)\n5.0\n(\u221215.0)\n11.7\n(\u221211.3)\n25.4\n(\u22123.7)\n35.6\n(2.0)\n45.2\n(7.3)\n52.5\n(11.4)\n51.1\n(10.6)\n41.2\n(5.1)\n29.5\n(\u22121.4)\n19.3\n(\u22127.1)\n9.7\n(\u221212.4)\n\u22121.5\n(\u221218.6)\nRecord low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\u221222\n(\u221230)\n\u221220\n(\u221229)\n\u22125\n(\u221221)\n11\n(\u221212)\n26\n(\u22123)\n34\n(1)\n42\n(6)\n39\n(4)\n31\n(\u22121)\n16\n(\u22129)\n\u22121\n(\u221218)\n\u221212\n(\u221224)\n\u221222\n(\u221230)\nAverage\nprecipitation\ninches (mm)\n2.96\n(75)\n2.62\n(67)\n3.15\n(80)\n3.32\n(84)\n3.83\n(97)\n4.12\n(105)\n4.26\n(108)\n3.52\n(89)\n3.30\n(84)\n2.83\n(72)\n2.86\n(73)\n2.84\n(72)\n39.61\n(1,006)\nAverage snowfall inches (cm)\n13.3\n(34)\n11.7\n(30)\n7.6\n(19)\n1.0\n(2.5)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.0\n(0.0)\n0.4\n(1.0)\n2.4\n(6.1)\n7.7\n(20)\n44.1\n(112)\nAverage precipitation days\n(\u2265 0.01 in)\n16.8\n13.9\n14.0\n13.9\n13.5\n12.4\n11.2\n10.5\n9.8\n11.1\n12.0\n14.6\n153.7\nAverage snowy days\n(\u2265 0.1 in)\n12.2\n9.3\n5.9\n1.6\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.3\n3.3\n7.6\n40.2\nAverage\nrelative humidity\n(%)\n69.9\n67.3\n64.1\n59.8\n63.4\n66.2\n68.8\n71.2\n72.0\n68.3\n70.2\n71.9\n67.8\nAverage\ndew point\n\u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n17.2\n(\u22128.2)\n18.9\n(\u22127.3)\n26.8\n(\u22122.9)\n34.5\n(1.4)\n45.9\n(7.7)\n55.2\n(12.9)\n60.1\n(15.6)\n59.5\n(15.3)\n53.4\n(11.9)\n40.8\n(4.9)\n32.4\n(0.2)\n23.2\n(\u22124.9)\n39.0\n(3.9)\nMean monthly\nsunshine hours\n93.9\n108.5\n155.4\n182.8\n217.4\n242.2\n254.9\n228.4\n196.7\n167.3\n99.4\n74.4\n2,021.3\nPercentage\npossible sunshine\n31\n36\n42\n46\n49\n54\n56\n54\n53\n48\n33\n26\n45\nAverage\nultraviolet index\n2\n2\n2\n4\n6\n6\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n4\nSource 1:\nNOAA\n(relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961\u20131990)\nSource 2: Weather Atlas (UV)\nAir quality\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.\nDespite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.\nIt also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.\nMost affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.\nAs of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's\nurban forest\nbetween $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.\nWater quality\nLocal rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to\nfrequently overflowing untreated sewage\nfrom the city's outdated infrastructure.\nPittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.\nInsufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.\nNine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers per year, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.\nThe\nAllegheny County Sanitary Authority\n(ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.\nThe\nPittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority\n(PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.\nWhile lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.\nIn response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.\nPWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.\nThere remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.\nSome people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.\nDemographics\nThis section needs to be\nupdated\n.\nPlease help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\n(\nJanuary 2025\n)\nHistorical population\nCensus\nPop.\nNote\n%\u00b1\n1800\n1,565\n\u2014\n1810\n4,768\n204.7%\n1820\n7,248\n52.0%\n1830\n12,568\n73.4%\n1840\n21,115\n68.0%\n1850\n46,601\n120.7%\n1860\n49,221\n5.6%\n1870\n86,076\n74.9%\n1880\n156,389\n81.7%\n1890\n238,617\n52.6%\n1900\n321,616\n34.8%\n1910\n533,905\n66.0%\n1920\n588,343\n10.2%\n1930\n669,817\n13.8%\n1940\n671,659\n0.3%\n1950\n676,806\n0.8%\n1960\n604,332\n\u221210.7%\n1970\n520,117\n\u221213.9%\n1980\n423,938\n\u221218.5%\n1990\n369,879\n\u221212.8%\n2000\n334,563\n\u22129.5%\n2010\n305,704\n\u22128.6%\n2020\n302,971\n\u22120.9%\n2024 (est.)\n307,668\n1.6%\nU.S. Decennial Census\nHistorical Racial composition\n2020\n2010\n1990\n1970\n1950\nWhite\n66.8%\n66.0%\n72.1%\n79.3%\n87.7%\n\u2013 Non-Hispanic White\n64.7%\n64.8%\n71.6%\n78.7%\nn/a\nBlack or African American\n23.0%\n26.1%\n25.8%\n20.2%\n12.2%\nAsian\n5.8%\n4.4%\n1.6%\n0.3%\n0.1%\nHispanic or Latino\n(of any race)\n3.2%\n2.3%\n0.9%\n0.5%\n(X)\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania \u2013 Racial and ethnic composition\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

There is also a small Asian community consisting of\nIndian immigrants\n, and a small Hispanic community consisting of\nMexicans\nand\nPuerto Ricans\n.\nIn 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older.

Outside of the city limits,\nDormont\nand\nMount Oliver\nwere Pittsburgh's most densely populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.\nMost of Pittsburgh's immigrants are\nfrom China\n,\nIndia\n,\nKorea\nand\nItaly\n.\nDemographic changes\nSince the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the Lower\nHill District\nunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the\nCivic Arena\n, which opened in 1961.\nThis project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.\nIn the 1960s, the\nUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh\n(URA) aimed to revitalize\nEast Liberty\n, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.\nBy the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like\nHome Depot\n, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate\ngentrification\nof neighborhoods.\nThe demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.\nReligion\nReligion in Pittsburgh (2014)\nReligion\nPercent\nProtestantism\n42%\nCatholicism\n32%\nOther\nChristian\n3%\nNo religion\n18%\nOthers\n4%\nDon't know\n1%\nAccording to a 2014 study by the\nPew Research Center\n, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered\nProtestant\n, and 32% professing\nCatholic\nbeliefs. 18% claimed no religious affiliation. The same study said that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively made up about 4% of the population.\nAccording to a 2010\nAssociation of Religion Data Archives\n(ARDA) study, residents included 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area.\nA 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at\nBrandeis University\nestimated the\nJewish population of Greater Pittsburgh\nwas 49,200.\nPittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to\nJehovah's Witnesses\nwas founded by\nCharles Taze Russell\n; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the\nPew Research Center\n.\nEconomy\nMain article:\nEconomy of Pittsburgh\nSee also:\nList of corporations in Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology,\nrobotics\n, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism,\nbiomedical technology\n, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8\u00a0billion in 2007,\nand in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.\nA\nNational Bureau of Economic Research\n2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility\nor the\nAmerican Dream\n.\nReflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space.

In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.\nAbout 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund.

While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.\nPittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the\nMonongahela Incline\nFunicular\nrailway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a\nlight rail\nsystem that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest\nbusway\nsystems.\nPittsburgh Regional Transit owns the\nDuquesne Incline\nbut it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,\nbut accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.\nThe Bus System lines are\nlabeled by number and letter\n. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as\nPittsburgh International Airport\n,\nMonroeville\n,\nMcCandless\n, and the borders of\nWestmoreland County\nand\nBeaver County, Pennsylvania\n. Meanwhile,\nthe light rail system\n(commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from\nAcrisure Stadium\nto\nSouth Hills Village\nand\nLibrary\n, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves\nCastle Shannon\n,\nMt.

The city is located in\nsouthwestern Pennsylvania\nat the confluence of the\nAllegheny River\nand\nMonongahela River\n, which combine to form the\nOhio River\n.\nIt is the\nsecond-most populous city in Pennsylvania\n, with a population of 302,971 at the\n2020 census\n. The\nPittsburgh metropolitan area\n, at over 2.43 million residents, is the largest metropolitan area in both the\nOhio Valley\nand\nAppalachia\n, the\nsecond-largest in Pennsylvania\n, and\n28th-largest in the U.S.\nThe greater\nPittsburgh\u2013Weirton\u2013Steubenville combined statistical area\nincludes parts of\nOhio\nand\nWest Virginia\n.\nPittsburgh is known as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the\nhistory of the U.S. steel industry\n.\nIt developed as a vital link of the\nAtlantic coast\nand\nMidwest\n, as the mineral-rich\nAllegheny Mountains\nled to the region being contested by the\nFrench\nand\nBritish\nempires,\nVirginians\n,\nWhiskey Rebels\n, and\nCivil War raiders\n.\nFor part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only\nNew York City\nand\nChicago\nin corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.\nDeindustrialization\nin the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among\nblue-collar workers\nas steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.\nHowever, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.\nPittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center\nand\nAllegheny Health Network\n, as well as\n68 colleges and universities\n, including\nCarnegie Mellon University\nand the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\n.\nThe area has served as the federal agency headquarters for\ncyber defense\n,\nsoftware engineering\n,\nrobotics\n,\nenergy research\n, and the\nnuclear navy\n.\nThe city is home to ten\nFortune 500\ncompanies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms.\nPittsburgh is sometimes called the \"City of Bridges\" for its\n446 bridges\n.\nIts rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the\nCarnegie Museums of Pittsburgh\n,\nPittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium\n,\nPhipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens\n, the\nNational Aviary\n, and a diverse\ncultural district\n.\nThe city's major league\nprofessional sports teams\ninclude the\nPittsburgh Steelers\n,\nPittsburgh Penguins\n, and\nPittsburgh Pirates\n. Pittsburgh is additionally where\nJehovah's Witnesses\ntraces its earliest origins, and was the host of the\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\n.\nEtymology\nMain article:\nName of Pittsburgh\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General\nJohn Forbes\n, in honor of British statesman\nWilliam Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham\n. As Forbes was a\nScotsman\n, he probably pronounced the name\n/\n\u02c8\np\n\u026a\nt\ns\nb\n\u0259r\n\u0259\n/\nPITS\n-b\u0259r-\u0259\n(similar to\nEdinburgh\n).\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a\nborough\non April 22, 1794, with the following Act:\n\"Be it enacted by the\nPennsylvania State Senate\nand\nPennsylvania House of Representatives\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final\nh\nwas retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.\nAfter a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the\nh\nwas reversed.\nThe\nPittsburg Press\ncontinued spelling the city without an\nh\nuntil 1921.\nHistory\nMain article:\nHistory of Pittsburgh\nFor a chronological guide, see\nTimeline of Pittsburgh\n.\nHistorical claims\nKingdom of France\n1690s\u20131763\nGreat Britain\n1681\u20131781\nUnited States\n1776\u2013present\nNative Americans\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the\nShawnee\nand several other settled groups of\nNative Americans\n.\nShannopin's Town\nwas an 18th-century\nLenape\n(Delaware) town located roughly from where\nPenn Avenue\nis today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to\nGeorge Croghan\n, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly\nHerr's Island\n, in what is now the\nLawrenceville\nneighborhood.\n18th century\nFurther information:\nPennsylvania in the American Revolution\nFort Pitt Block House\n, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer\nRobert de La Salle\nfrom\nQuebec\nduring his 1669 expedition down the\nOhio River\n.\n[\nbetter\u00a0source\u00a0needed\n]\nEuropean pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European\nfur traders\nestablished area posts and settlements.\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite\nCanada\nwith\nFrench Louisiana\nvia the rivers.\nDuring 1753\u20131754, the British hastily built\nFort Prince George\nbefore a larger French force drove them off. The French built\nFort Duquesne\nbased on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The\nFrench and Indian War\n, the North American front of the\nSeven Years' War\n, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General\nEdward Braddock\nwas dispatched with Major\nGeorge Washington\nas his aide to take Fort Duquesne.\nThe British and colonial force were defeated at\nBraddock's Field\n. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on\nFort Pitt\n, named after\nWilliam Pitt the Elder\n, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".\nDuring\nPontiac's War\n, a loose confederation of Native American tribes\nlaid siege to Fort Pitt\nin 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel\nHenry Bouquet\ndefeated a portion of the besieging force at the\nBattle of Bushy Run\n. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the\nIroquois Confederacy\n, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768\nTreaty of Fort Stanwix\n, the\nPenns\nwere allowed to purchase the modern region from the\nIroquois\n. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".\nBoth the\nColony of Virginia\nand the\nProvince of Pennsylvania\nclaimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the\nMason\u2013Dixon line\nwestward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771,\nBedford County, Pennsylvania\nwas created to govern the frontier.\nOn April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as\nPitt Township\n.\nWilliam Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.\nFollowing the\nAmerican Revolution\n, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the\nOhio Country\n. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette\nwas started, and in 1787, the\nPittsburgh Academy\nwas chartered. Unrest during the\nWhiskey Rebellion\nof 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the\nAppalachian Mountains\nor through the\nGreat Lakes\n.\nFort Pitt\n(now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the\nNorthwest Territory\n.\n19th century\nFurther information:\nPennsylvania in the American Civil War\nThe\nMonongahela River\nand its surroundings in 1857\nLithograph\nof Pittsburgh by\nOtto Krebs\n(before 1874)\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the\nLewis and Clark Expedition\n.\nPreparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when\nMeriwether Lewis\npurchased a\nkeelboat\nthat would later be used to ascend the\nMissouri River\n.\nThe\nWar of 1812\ncut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\nIn the 1830s, many\nWelsh people\nfrom the\nMerthyr\nsteelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the\nMerthyr Rising\n. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the\nAllegheny Mountains\n. The\nGreat Fire of Pittsburgh\ndestroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the\nGreat Famine\n. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22\u00a0million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from\nGermany\n.\nBurning of Union Depot during the\nPittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the\nUnderground Railroad\nin the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.\nThe Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.\nSometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850\nFugitive Slave Act\n, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.\nThe\nAmerican Civil War\nboosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union.\nAndrew Carnegie\nbegan steel production in 1875 at the\nEdgar Thomson Steel Works\nin\nNorth Braddock, Pennsylvania\n, which evolved into the\nCarnegie Steel Company\n. He adopted the\nBessemer process\nto increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n20th century\nAn aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902\nSteel mills in the\nStrip District\nin 1906\nIn 1901,\nJ. P. Morgan\nand attorney\nElbert H. Gary\nmerged\nCarnegie Steel Company\nand several other companies into\nU.S. Steel\n. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the\nnation's eighth-largest city\n, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\nThe\nPittsburgh Agreement\nwas subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by\nT. G. Masaryk\n, concerning the future foundation of\nCzechoslovakia\n.\nThe city suffered\nsevere flooding\nin March 1936.\nThe city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.\nPittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American\nGreat Migration\nfrom the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.\nLimited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.\nDuring\nWorld War II\n, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\u00a0million tons of steel for the war effort.\nThis resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"\nwas being overshadowed by\nJames Parton\n's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n21st century\nDuring the\nlate 2000s recession\n, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the\nPittsburgh\nmetropolitan statistical area\n(MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.\nIn September 2009, the\n2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit\nwas held in Pittsburgh.\nGeography\nSee also:\nPittsburgh metropolitan area \u00a7\u00a0Regional identity\nThe\nDuquesne Incline\nfrom\nMount Washington\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151\u00a0km\n2\n), of which 55.6 square miles (144\u00a0km\n2\n) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3\u00a0km\n2\n), or 4.75%, is water.

More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.\nThe\nsteps of Pittsburgh\nconsist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.\nMany provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.\nBike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The\nGreat Allegheny Passage\nand\nChesapeake and Ohio Canal\nTowpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539\u00a0km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\nCityscape\nMain articles:\nDowntown Pittsburgh\n,\nNorth Side (Pittsburgh)\n,\nSouth Side (Pittsburgh)\n, and\nWest End (Pittsburgh)\nSee also:\nList of Pittsburgh neighborhoods\n,\nList of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh\n,\nList of City of Pittsburgh historic designations\n, and\nList of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks\nPittsburgh's\n90 distinct neighborhoods\nEast Carson Street in the\nSouth Side Flats\nShadyside\nneighborhood\nThe city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,\nand four main areas surrounding it\u2014Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.

A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.\nIt also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.\nMost affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.\nAs of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's\nurban forest\nbetween $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.\nWater quality\nLocal rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to\nfrequently overflowing untreated sewage\nfrom the city's outdated infrastructure.\nPittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.\nInsufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.\nNine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers per year, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.\nThe\nAllegheny County Sanitary Authority\n(ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.\nThe\nPittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority\n(PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.\nWhile lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.\nIn response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.\nPWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.\nThere remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.\nSome people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.\nDemographics\nThis section needs to be\nupdated\n.\nPlease help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.\n(\nJanuary 2025\n)\nHistorical population\nCensus\nPop.\nNote\n%\u00b1\n1800\n1,565\n\u2014\n1810\n4,768\n204.7%\n1820\n7,248\n52.0%\n1830\n12,568\n73.4%\n1840\n21,115\n68.0%\n1850\n46,601\n120.7%\n1860\n49,221\n5.6%\n1870\n86,076\n74.9%\n1880\n156,389\n81.7%\n1890\n238,617\n52.6%\n1900\n321,616\n34.8%\n1910\n533,905\n66.0%\n1920\n588,343\n10.2%\n1930\n669,817\n13.8%\n1940\n671,659\n0.3%\n1950\n676,806\n0.8%\n1960\n604,332\n\u221210.7%\n1970\n520,117\n\u221213.9%\n1980\n423,938\n\u221218.5%\n1990\n369,879\n\u221212.8%\n2000\n334,563\n\u22129.5%\n2010\n305,704\n\u22128.6%\n2020\n302,971\n\u22120.9%\n2024 (est.)\n307,668\n1.6%\nU.S. Decennial Census\nHistorical Racial composition\n2020\n2010\n1990\n1970\n1950\nWhite\n66.8%\n66.0%\n72.1%\n79.3%\n87.7%\n\u2013 Non-Hispanic White\n64.7%\n64.8%\n71.6%\n78.7%\nn/a\nBlack or African American\n23.0%\n26.1%\n25.8%\n20.2%\n12.2%\nAsian\n5.8%\n4.4%\n1.6%\n0.3%\n0.1%\nHispanic or Latino\n(of any race)\n3.2%\n2.3%\n0.9%\n0.5%\n(X)\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania \u2013 Racial and ethnic composition\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

In the 1950s, the Lower\nHill District\nunderwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the\nCivic Arena\n, which opened in 1961.\nThis project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.\nIn the 1960s, the\nUrban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh\n(URA) aimed to revitalize\nEast Liberty\n, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.\nBy the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like\nHome Depot\n, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.\nThese changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate\ngentrification\nof neighborhoods.\nThe demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.\nReligion\nReligion in Pittsburgh (2014)\nReligion\nPercent\nProtestantism\n42%\nCatholicism\n32%\nOther\nChristian\n3%\nNo religion\n18%\nOthers\n4%\nDon't know\n1%\nAccording to a 2014 study by the\nPew Research Center\n, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered\nProtestant\n, and 32% professing\nCatholic\nbeliefs. 18% claimed no religious affiliation.

    "https://www.cmu.edu/about/history.html": "History\nHome\n/\nAbout Carnegie Mellon\n/\nHistory\nFounder Spotlight\nA self-educated \"working boy,\" Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century.\n\"My heart is in the work,\" he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto.\nAt one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie once said, \"To die rich is to die disgraced.\" He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed.\nCMU's Origin\n1900: Initial Funding for Carnegie Technical Schools\nIn 1900, Andrew Carnegie donated $1 million to the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities.\nThe Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College.\nInitial number of students\nThe first Carnegie Technical Schools class was admitted in 1906.\nDegrees Introduced\n1912: Carnegie Tech Grants Bachelor's Degrees\nSoon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools changed its name to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or \"Carnegie Tech\", and began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts.\nCarnegie Tech set the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China.\nFirst U.S. Drama Class\nactors\nThe first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech.\nInvestment in Expansion\nEarly 20th Century Progress\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th-century campus designed in the Beaux Arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories \u2014 the hands-on center of learning that persists today.\nCarnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him.\nHumanities Requirement\n% of curriculum\nWith the goal of understanding societal needs, the Carnegie Plan began in 1938. Science and engineering students were now required to take humanities and social sciences courses.\nPost-war Growth: Opening Three New Schools\nWith the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study.\nUniversity culture also changed in 1973, when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms.\n1948\nThe Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the\nDavid A. Tepper School of Business\n, focused on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science.\n1968\nThe School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the\nH. John Heinz III College\n, provided graduate training for work in the public sector.\n1986\nThe\nSchool of Computer Science\npioneered computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon.\n1967 - Present\nThe CMU of Today\nIn 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as\nCarnegie Mellon University\n.\nThis support from the Mellons allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as the\nMarianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences\n.\nIn 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech\u2013Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery.\n2025 Student Count\nCMU's Global Leadership\nIn its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe \u2014 from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists.\nIn the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh.\nToday its global presence includes campuses in\nQatar\nand\nSilicon Valley, Calif.\n, more than a dozen degree-granting locations, and more than 20 research partnerships in cities and countries such as\nLos Angeles\n,\nNew York City\n,\nWashington, D.C.\n,\nChina\n,\nPortugal\nand\nRwanda\n.\n2002\nCarnegie Mellon established a\nbranch campus in Silicon Valley\n, the epicenter of the modern technological revolution.\n2004\nCarnegie University in Qatar (CMU-Q)\nopened its doors with 41 students, offering programs in Business Administration and Computer Science.\n2011\nCarnegie Mellon University and the Government of Rwanda signed an agreement to establish\nCMU-Africa\n. This partnership was designed to respond to the critical shortage of high-quality engineering talent required to harness Africa's tremendous potential as home to the fastest-growing workforce in the world.\nExpanding into the Future\nCMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900.\nAt the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.\nExplore our Strategic Framework 2025",

The \nMayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council\u2019s nine representatives are elected to \noffice by residents in each of their respective districts.\nThe Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or \nfraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with \nreporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City\u2019s fiscal condition. Every \nyear, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information \non Pittsburgh\u2019s short-term and long-term financial outlook.\nCity Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also \napproves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital \nBudgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of \nCity government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.\nCity Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The \nCity Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information \nresource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget \nDivision monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations.  It prepares and distributes \nto Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City \nof Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special \nreports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.\nThe Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly \nresponsible for much of the City\u2019s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices, \nBureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to \ndebt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law \nacts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella \norganizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire, \nEmergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and \nSafety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations, \nEnvironmental Services, and Facilities.\nAdditionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City\u2019s managerial \nhierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City\u2019s General Fund. For this reason, these \nAuthorities are not included in the Operating Budget.\nA comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart \npresented in this document. \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n18\n\nWhat is the Operating Budget?\nThe Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are \nfigures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are \nspread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the \nadministration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public \nsafety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and \nprogramming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the \nroutine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers\u2019 \ncompensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.\nThe City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are \ncollected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses, \ncharges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other \nrevenue generating mechanisms. \nThe Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what \ngovernmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal \nyear. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in \ndelivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.\nThe Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and \nMembers of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the \nCity of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of \nPittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire \nthrough tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must \nprioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the \nCity. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits \npriorities set by the City\u2019s elected public officials.\nFinally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of \nPittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the \nCity of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating \nBudget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial \ncreation of the plan.\nBasis of Accounting\nThe General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh \nrecognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.\nThe Fiscal Year\nThe City of Pittsburgh\u2019s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of \neach year. This can only be changed by ordinance.\nBalanced Budget Mandate\nThe City\u2019s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues \nequal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, \nthe budget surplus is transferred into the City\u2019s reserve fund balance.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n19\n\nThe City\u2019s Fund Structure\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City\u2019s financial reporting system is organized on \na fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.\n \nGovernmental Funds\nGeneral Fund\nCapital Projects Fund\nCommunity Development Funds\nSpecial Revenues Funds\nFiduciary Funds\nPension Trust Fund\nAgency Funds\nThe General Fund is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain \nmost of the City\u2019s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general \nadministration.\nThe Capital Projects Fund  is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or \nprogram (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to \nprovide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum \nvalue of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from \nthree major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on \nthe Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document.\nCommunity Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and \nhuman services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.\nSpecial Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or \ncommitted for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership \nFund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for \ntwo of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word \n\u201ctrust\u201d in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the \nfunds are not held by any trustees or custodians.\n \nFiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These \nresources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s own operations and are custodial in nature. The \nCity\u2019s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.\n\u2022 The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for \nfirefighters, and a third for municipal employees.\n\u2022 Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax \nrefunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other \nPost-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of \nFiduciary Funds.\nBudget Allocations\nThis budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that \ncomprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n20\n\nThe City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and \nElected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the \nmost specific:\n Fund ... Cost Center ... Subclass ... Object Account\nThe legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101. Costs are \nnext delineated by distributing funds across the City\u2019s divisions, referred to here as cost centers.\nCity Offices, Departments, and Bureaus (Cost Centers)\n106000  Office of the City Controller\n101100  City Council Districts\n101200  City Council as a Body\n102000  Office of the Mayor\n102200  Office of Management and Budget\n103000  Department of Innovation and Performance\n105000  Commission on Human Relations\n107000  Department of Finance\n108000  Department of Law\n108100  Ethics Hearing Board\n240000  Office of Municipal Investigations\n109000  Department of Human Resources and Civil Service\n110000  Department of City Planning\n130000  Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections\n210000  Department of Public Safety \u2013 Bureau of Administration\n220000  Bureau of Emergency Medical Services\n230000  Bureau of Police\n250000  Bureau of Fire\n280000  Bureau of Animal Care and Control\n102300  Office of Community Health and Safety\n410000  Department of Public Works \u2013 Bureau of Administration\n420000  Bureau of Operations\n430000  Bureau of Environmental Services\n450000  Bureau of Facilities\n500000  Department of Parks and Recreation\n600000  Department of Mobility and Infrastructure\n999900  Citizen Police Review Board\nCosts are next directly assigned to a subclass, which is a general expenditures category. These include personnel \ncosts and costs incurred as a result of general operations.\nSubclasses\n51  Personnel - Salaries and Wages\n52  Personnel - Employment Benefits\n53  Professional and Technical Services\n54  Property Services\n55  Other Services\n56  Supplies\n57  Property\n58  Miscellaneous\n82  Debt Service\n90  Transfers\n91  Transfers - Out\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n21\n\nThe chart of accounts delineates these subclasses into further detail called object accounts. Object accounts are \nthe most detailed level to which the City of Pittsburgh budgets.\nExpenditures are both budgeted and recorded using the account string depicted below. The account string begins \nby identifying the fund, followed by the cost center (City division), subclass (expenditure category), object account \n(expenditure category detail), and fiscal year. Below is an example account string that represents expenditures \nrelated to postage for the Department of Finance.\n11101.107000.56.56105.2024\n11101 107000 56 56105 2024\nGeneral \nFund\nDept. of \nFinance\nSupplies Postage Fiscal \nYear\nWhat Are the City's Sources of Revenues?\nAnnual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources. There are seven subclasses.\n \nRevenues\n41  Tax Revenue\n42  License and Permit Revenue\n43  Charges for Services\n44  Fines and Forfeitures\n45  Intergovernmental Revenue\n46  Interest Earnings\n47  Miscellaneous Revenues\nTax Revenue\nTaxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are \nmany that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City. \nThey are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.\nReal estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School \nDistrict, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within \nthe City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property \nAssessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2023, the City real estate \ntax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax \nrate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny \nCounty Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).\nOther sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax, \nthe Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the \nDeed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax. \nEarned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn \nwages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2 \npercent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security, \nand capital gains are commonly excluded.\nThe Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied \nat the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed \nindividuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide \nservices within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n22\n\nFinally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of \nPittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s pension fund until 2051.\nIn 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total City revenue.\nCity of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for \nthe improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Stop \nthe Violence Trust Fund section for more information.\nNon-tax Revenue\n\u201cNon-tax revenue\u201d is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not \ndirectly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction \npermits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as \ninterest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue \nfor the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.\nEach year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of \ngrants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account \nconsists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most \nintergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local \nentities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal \nagencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the \nquality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden. \nMany City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees \ninclude payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale \nof rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and \ngovernmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to \nreceive medical care.\nIn 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total City revenue.\nHow Does the City Spend Money?\nThe tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents \nranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by \ndepartment or division and by subclass.\nMajor expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers\u2019 compensation claims for City \nof Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past \nand current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart \nbelow illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) \ncontributions, health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n23\n\n \n$ (Millions)\nSelect Major Expenditures, 2018-2022\n2018 2019 2020\n2021 2022\nHealth Insurance\nWorkers' Compensation\nPension and OPEB\nDebt Service\n0\n50,000,000\n100,000,000\n150,000,000\nHealth Insurance\nThese expenditures are categorized within the Personnel \u2013 Employment Benefits subclass.

These expenditures are housed within the Personnel \u2013 Employment Benefits subclass in the Department \nof Finance and are organized via the following individual accounts:\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n24\n\n \nPension and OPEB\n52401  Pension Contribution\n52404  Retiree Contribution\n52407  Widow(er) Contribution\n52410  Survivor Contribution\n52413  Additional Pension Fund\n52416  Early Retirement Healthcare\n52419  Retired Police Officer\n52422  Retired Firefighters\n52423  Retired EMS\n52605  Retirement Severance\n52901  OPEB Contribution\nDebt Service\nDebt service is defined as payments made to the principal and interest balances of previously issued municipal \nbonds in order to ensure their timely retirement. Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of \nFinance and is composed of the following accounts:\n \nDebt Service\n82101  Interest Expense - Bonds\n82103  Principal\nBudget Creation Process\nThe operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations, \npolicy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by \nCity Code.\nAfter receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit \nproposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements, \nrequests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the \nproposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if \nany, should be funded.\nThe Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to \ngarner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor\u2019s \nstrategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.\nCity Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After \nconsideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a \nvote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st.  Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of \nthe new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to \ncollective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before \nDecember 31st was 1931.  \nUpon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Operating and \nCapital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City\u2019s expenditures and revenues, provides \nlegislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments. \nAnalysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure \ncategories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important \nmanagement initiatives.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n25\n\nFive-Year Financial Forecast\nIn addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both \nexpenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise \nthe five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.\nThe five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This \naids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-\nterm impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for \nlong-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might \nresult in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus \nensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.\nRevenue Forecast\nRevenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and \ndeliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the \nrights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nProjected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.\nThe Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts. \nPrevious years\u2019 financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-\nyear financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City\u2019s enterprise resource planning \n(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue \nline. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.\nIn addition to the previous years\u2019 financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic \nvariables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue \ngenerating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the \nBureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the \nNational Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.\nRevenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of \nPittsburgh\u2019s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are \ndeveloped in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are \nreasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections \nare finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.\nExpenditure Forecast\nOMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these \nforecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known \nexpenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension \ncontributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).\nOMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and \ninitiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are \nsubject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This \nis accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,\nLastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described \nabove. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in \nachieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests \nand evaluates how they relate to the Mayor\u2019s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that \nfall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division\u2019s budget in the five-year forecast.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n26\n\nHow to Read the Budget\nThroughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate \nsection of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference \nbetween each report within a section. \nDepartmental Sections\nThe most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in \nthe Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been \nappropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the \nDepartmental Sections of the Operating Budget. \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\n27\n\nOrganization Chart\nThe organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau, \nor Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with \nthe exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.\nDepartmental Overview\nAt the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the \norganization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the \ndepartment. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency, \nBureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.\nPosition Summary\nThe position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or \u201cFTE,\u201d \nrepresents the number of full-time workers in the position. The \u201cRate/Grade\u201d category indicates how an \nemployee\u2019s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees \ncan be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a \u201c12\u201d in the \u201cHours/Months\u201d column \nindicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or \nending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The \n\u201cBudget\u201d column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The \n\u201cVacancy Allowance\u201d adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions \nthroughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons.\nSubclass Detail\nThis portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass \nand object account level. For example, the general \u201cProfessional and Technical Services\u201d subclass will highlight \nthe appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as \u201cAdministrative Fees,\u201d \u201cWorkforce Training,\u201d and \n\u201cComputer Maintenance.\u201d Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted \nexpenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024 \nbudgeted amounts.\nUnder the Personnel \u2013 Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular\n salary represents \nthe total base pay for the organization. Longevity  pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining \nagreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances  are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or \nseasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs \nare listed accordingly. Leave Buyback  represents sick leave hours that can be \u201csold back\u201d to the City. Premium \nPay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements  are funds from outside sources that are \nused to offset certain position expenses.\nFive-Year Forecasts\nFinally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to \nthe 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included \nas a reference point.\nNote for Fund Accounts\nFor special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2024 summary is \ncomposed of the \u201cProjected Beginning Balance\u201d for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and \nthe \u201cProjected Ending Balance\u201d for December 31, 2024. These funds carry over from year to year.

The forecasts are based on economic assumptions, recent collection trends, and \ncurrent laws and policies. However, actual revenues could vary from forecasts due to unforeseeable economic \nand technical factors.\n2024 Operating Budget Revenue\nRevenues are divided into tax and non-tax revenues. In 2024, tax revenues are budgeted at approximately $541.8 \nmillion and non-tax revenues are budgeted at $172.4 million, comprising approximately 75.9 percent and 24.1 \npercent of total revenues, respectively. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.5 percent in 2024 over the \n2023 budget. \nTax Revenue\nTax revenues incorporate all major taxes that are levied by the City of Pittsburgh. For each tax, total revenues \ninclude current year collections, prior year collections and penalties and interest. Tax revenues are forecast to \nincrease by 1.2 percent in 2024 over the 2023 budget and to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.\nReal Estate Tax\nTotal real estate tax revenues are budgeted at $151.8 million in 2024, an estimated 4.7 percent decrease from the \nprior year. The real estate tax is the largest source of revenue in the 2024 Operating Budget, comprising \napproximately 28.0 percent of tax revenues and 21.3 percent of total revenues. Current year real estate tax \nliability (the amount billed at the beginning of the year) is calculated by applying the millage rate (8.06 mils) to \nAllegheny County's assessed value of property. On average, residential property comprises approximately 55 \npercent of the total assessed value of property in the City of Pittsburgh and non-residential property comprises \napproximately 45 percent. Prior to the county-wide reassessment effective in 2013, the total assessed value of \nproperty in the City grew by approximately 1.2 percent on average per year since 2003. The county-wide \nreassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total assessed value decreased \nby 7.8 percent in 2014. Since then, the total assessed value of property has grown by 1.1 percent on average per \nyear, more in line with historical growth. \nThe largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the \nAllegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2 \npercent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax.  Real estate tax incentives for future years are \nestimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment. Total real estate tax \nrevenues are forecast to increase by 0.8 percent each year through 2028.\nEarned Income Tax\nTotal earned income tax revenues are budgeted at $136.2 million in 2024, an estimated 7.3 percent increase over \nthe prior year. The earned income tax is a 1.25 percent levy on the wages and net profits of residents of the City \nof Pittsburgh. The earned income tax forecast projects tax year liabilities based on a 3.0 percent growth rate, with \na downward adjustment for the City of Pittsburgh, and splits current and prior year liabilities based on historical \ncollections. Total earned income tax revenues are forecast to increase by 4.4 percent each year through 2028.  \nPayroll Preparation Tax\nTotal payroll preparation tax revenues are budgeted at $76.3 million in 2024, an estimated 16.0 percent increase \nover the prior year. The payroll preparation tax is levied at a rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers \nand net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations and joint ventures who \nperform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh.  Non-profits an exempt from this tax. The payroll \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  \nFiscal Year 2024  Revenue\n39\n\npreparation tax forecast uses total non-farm wages for Allegheny County to forecast future revenues. Total non-\nfarm wages for Allegheny County are forecast to increase by 4.0 percent on average.  Total payroll preparation tax \nrevenues are forecast to increase by 2.2 percent each year through 2028.\nParking Tax\nTotal parking tax revenues are budgeted at $51.6 million in 2024, a 1.9 percent decrease from the prior year. The \nparking tax is levied at a rate of 37.5 percent on fees charged for parking or storing cars within the City of \nPittsburgh. The parking tax forecast uses a multivariate regression with collections as the dependent variable and \nthe tax rate and gross Allegheny County product as independent variables. Estimated gross Allegheny County \nproduct is the total value of goods produced and services provided in the county, and serves as a broad economic \nindicator of activity in and around the City. Total parking tax revenues are forecast to increase by 3.7 percent each \nyear through 2028. \nDeed Transfer Tax\nDeed transfer tax revenues are budgeted at $59.1 million in 2024, an estimated 13.7 percent decrease compared \nwith the prior year. This decrease is related to fewer property transactions in comparison to last year as a result of \nrising interest rates.  The tax is levied at a rate of 3 percent on real property transfers within the City of Pittsburgh. \nThe total tax paid, which is typically split between the buyer and seller of a property, is 5% as of 2020, as the state \nand school board each also levy 1% taxes of their own.  \nThe deed transfer tax forecast (provided by IHS Markit) uses a multivariate regression with collections as the \ndependent variable and three independent variables. The first independent variable is the residential tax base, \nwhich consists of existing single-family home sales multiplied by the average price of an existing single-family \nhome. The other independent variables are the tax rate and a dummy variable for years in which the sale of a \nnon-residential property exceeded $100 million. Total deed transfer tax revenues are forecast to increase by 1.2 \npercent on average each year over the next five years.\nRegional Asset District Tax Relief\nRegional Asset District tax relief is budgeted at $25.8 million in 2024, an estimated 3.3 percent increase over the \nprior year. This relief, created by Pennsylvania Act 77 of 1993, provides the City of Pittsburgh with a percentage of \n1/4 of the 1 percent additional sales tax in Allegheny County. The City of Pittsburgh\u2019s percentage is determined by \na formula that compares the City\u2019s tax revenues and the market value of property per capita with that of all \nmunicipalities in Allegheny County. Retail sales (a proxy for sales tax collections) are forecast to grow by 3.1 \npercent on average over the same period.  Act 77 tax relief is forecast to increase by 2.0 percent each year \nthrough 2028.\nAmusement Tax\nTotal amusement tax revenues are budgeted at $18.9 million in 2024, an estimated 9.2 percent increase over the \nprior year. The amusement tax is levied at a rate of 5 percent on the gross admission to events that provide \nentertainment within the City of Pittsburgh, excluding non-profit performing arts organizations. Amusement tax \ncollections are primarily motivated by sporting events within the City. Revenues from the three professional sports \nteams have historically comprised 70 percent of amusement tax revenues on average per year. Revenues from \nopposing teams and non-resident performers comprise the remainder of the amusement tax revenues. A sports \nteams and clubs economic indicator is used to forecast 70 percent of amusement tax revenues. The remaining 30 \npercent is forecast with consumer price index (inflation) to generate a more conservative forecast. Total \namusement tax revenues are forecast to increase by 2.6 percent each year through 2028.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget  \nFiscal Year 2024  Revenue\n40\n\nLocal Service Tax\nTotal local service tax revenues are budgeted at $15.7 million in 2024, an estimated 3.2 percent increase over the \nprior year. The local service tax is a weekly tax of $1 per employee working within the City of Pittsburgh earning \ngreater than $12,000 annually. The local service tax forecast uses annual employment forecasts for the City of \nPittsburgh to project revenues. Total local service tax revenues are forecast to decrease by 0.6 percent per year \nthrough 2028.\nNon-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee\nTo offset the revenue loss from phasing out the tax on non-profit performing arts organizations, the non-resident \nsports facility usage fee was established in 2005. Total non-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are \nbudgeted at $4.4 million in 2024, an estimated 99.3 percent increase over the prior year. The fee is 3 percent of \nthe earned income generated by non-residents using a publicly funded facility to engage in an athletic event or \nperformance.  This results in a conservative forecast with growth slightly above the consumer price index. Total \nnon-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are forecast to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.\nTelecommunication Licensing Fee\nThe telecommunication licensing fee is budgeted at $1.2 million in 2024, a 26.5 percent decrease compared with \nthe prior year. The fee is levied on telecommunications companies for the privilege of running lines under public \nstreets, bridges and sidewalks. Total telecommunication licensing fee collections are forecast to increase by 1.0 \npercent each year through 2028.\nInstitution and Service Privilege Tax\nThe institution and service privilege tax is budgeted at $460,644 in 2024, an estimated 16.8 percent decrease \nover the prior year. The tax is levied on the gross income of foundations, partnerships and non-profit organizations \nthat provide a public service. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.7 percent each year through 2028, \nroughly in line with inflation. \nNon-Profit Payments for Services\nNon-profit payments for services are contractual payments from the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for \nsome of their properties that have been taken off the tax rolls. The total budget for this line item is $438,891 in \n2024.\nOutdoor Advertising Excise Tax\nCity Council enacted an outdoor advertising excise tax in 2013. This tax on billboards was estimated to bring in \n$1.2 to $2.0 million dollars annually to the City. This tax is currently in litigation; no tax revenue has been collected \nby the City.  \nNon-Tax Revenues\nNon-tax revenues are divided into six categories: licenses and permits, charges for service, fines and forfeitures, \nintergovernmental revenue, interest earnings, and miscellaneous revenues. Non-tax revenues are forecast to \nincrease by 6.9 percent in 2024 over the prior year and decrease by 6.1 percent each year through 2028.\nLicenses and Permits\nTotal revenues for the licenses and permits category are budgeted at $17.1 million in 2024, an estimated 7.2 \npercent increase over the prior year. Licenses account for 5.0 percent of this revenue and permits account for \n94.7 percent 2024.

In total, these departments account \nfor 70.1 percent of total expenditures in the 2024 Operating Budget.

The City plans to achieve these by:\n\u2022 Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services\n\u2022 Managing the City\u2019s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations\n\u2022 Keeping the City\u2019s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and \nprovide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases\n\u2022 Maintaining the City\u2019s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary\nThe 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and \nimprove the City\u2019s long-term fiscal health by:\n\u2022 Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated \nminimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC)\n\u2022 Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City\u2019s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of General \nFund expenditures in 2024\n\u2022 Allocating a $22.6 million in \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan\nIn addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key \ncomponents and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following:\n\u2022 Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase \nworkplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost \nmanagement initiative.\n\u2022 Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees, \nworkers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer \ncontributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few \nyears, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget \nFiscal Year 2024 Expenditures\n52\n\nhealth and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension \nfunding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.\n\u2022 Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required \ncosts that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across \neach department. \n\u2022 Debt Service: The forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in \n2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City\u2019s critical infrastructure \nneeds.\n\u2022 PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the \nCapital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d) transfers are funds that the City spends on \ncapital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2024 Capital \nImprovement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement, \neconomic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to \ncontribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing \n$22.578036 million in 2024 and a total of $21.4 million from 2025 to 2028.\nMost non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout \nfiscal year 2028. Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027.\n2024-2028 Spending by Subclass\n51 Personnel-Salaries & Wages\n52 Personnel-Employee Benefits\n53 Professional & Technical Services\n54 Property Services\n55 Other Services\n56 Supplies\n57 Property\n58 Miscellaneous\n82 Debt Service\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028\n$0\n$200,000,000\n$400,000,000\n$600,000,000\n$800,000,000\nThe 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan achieves substantial improvements in terms of the percentage of \ntotal expenditures related to debt service. In fiscal year 2015 expenditures related to debt service reached \n$89,289,167. This represented 18.6 percent of total budgeted expenditures. In the 2024 Operating Budget, total \nplanned expenditures related to debt service is $69,390,272, or 10.1 percent of total budgeted expenditures. This \ntrend illustrates the City\u2019s commitment to long term financial health. The long term impact of this plan will allow the \nCity to responsibly borrow at more favorable rates, comply with the City\u2019s debt policy, and provide resources to \ninvest in the City\u2019s assets.\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget \nFiscal Year 2024 Expenditures\n53\n\nDebt Service\nBudget Total Debt Service\nPercent of Total Expenditures\n2018 (actual)2019 (actual)2020 (actual)2021 (actual)2022 (actual)2023 (projected)2024 (projected)2025 (projected)2026 (projected)2027 (projected)2028 (projected)\n$0\n$200,000,000\n$400,000,000\n$600,000,000\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget \nFiscal Year 2024 Expenditures\n54\n\n51 -

In addition to the advanced life support units the bureau also staffs four basic life \nsupport ambulances staffed by Pennsylvania Department of Health Certified Emergency Medical Technicians. \nStrategically located throughout the City, the Bureau will operate thirteen advanced life support (ALS) and three \nbasic life support (BLS) ambulances 24 hours per day when at full staffing capacity.\n \nWith advanced training and technology, the Bureau of EMS is delivering cutting-edge care by providing new \ntreatment modalities that allow for more effective recognition and treatment of heart attacks, strokes, cardiac \narrest, and a number of other life threatening conditions. For patients experiencing ST Elevation Myocardial \nInfarction (STEMI), EMS has the ability to screen and directly transmit an EKG to the receiving hospital and \nactivate the cardiac cauterization laboratory prior to arrival, greatly reducing the time to definitive treatment.\nThe Bureau of EMS also provides integrated medically-directed rescue for vehicle accidents, industrial accidents, \nhigh and low angle rope rescues, confined space emergencies, building collapse, elevator emergencies, and \nothers. The base service is comprised of two specially equipped rescue trucks, each staffed by two paramedics, \noperating 24 hours a day.

For each team, EMS provides an administrative and leadership role as well \nas a cadre of highly qualified personnel and instructors. \nFor River Rescue, EMS provides two Paramedic Public Safety SCUBA divers to staff the units. The Bureau of \nPolice assigns an officer/helmsman who provides a law enforcement component to the units. This unit conducts \nport security and safety patrols on a routine basis. \nFor the SWAT Team, EMS provides trained Tactical EMS (TEMS) personnel who have undergone all of the \nrequired SWAT training in addition to specialized treatment under fire training. They respond as an integral \nelement of the SWAT Team to multiple incidents such as barricaded persons, high risk warrants, and dignitary \nprotection.\nFor the Hazmat Team, EMS participates with the Bureaus of Fire and Police, providing personnel trained and \ncertified to the Technician level for entry, evaluation, mitigation, and decontamination.

Through partnerships and program development, \nthe Office will focus on:\nDeveloping a Continuum of Support:  Through continued collaboration with first responders and community \nmembers, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and \nevaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of \nresources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public \nSafety partners.  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis \nwill be utilized to build this continuum.\nImplementation of Public Health-Informed Practices:  Public Safety personnel consistently respond to \ncommunity needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders \nhave significant exposure to issues that affect community members\u2019 health and well-being.  OCH&S will work with \nthe Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and \nresponses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by \ncommunity members.  Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate \ntranslational experiences.\nConsistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and \naccountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the \ncurrent response continuum.  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, \nprioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth.  OCH&S will \npartner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and \nmay not engage in traditional meetings.  Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives \nfocused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.\nNote: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.\n \nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget                                Office of Community Health and Safety\nFiscal Year 2024  102300\n196\n\n2023 Accomplishments\n\u2022 Launch of Co-Response in 2023 in Police Zones 1 & 2, which includes Downtown Pittsburgh. In the last \nmonth alone, the team has successfully prevented 3 jumpers from reaching completion. It also played an \nintegral role in resolving a 90+ person migrant crisis at the Greyhound. In total, it has seen 107 patients \nserved, 307 service encounters, and 143 reasons for referral since April 2023. \n\u2022 Launch of the Trauma Survivors Assistance Program this summer, with already achieving over 700 \nencounters and providing support to the community during and after the Garfield shooting. \n\u2022 The Office of Community Health & Safety launched a Downtown Crisis Response Case Conference with \nDHS Leadership, outreach organizations, and OCHS Leadership to best address the most complex cases \naffecting downtown. The target audience are individuals who are in crisis, experience homelessness and \nextreme poverty, and have high engagement with law enforcement and the criminal/legal system. \n\u2022 Secured $1 million in federal funding to launch Post Overdose Support Teams (POST) next year which \nwill perform secondary response to individuals who refuse medical treatment after experiencing an \noverdose.

The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide \nindependent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  To accomplish this assignment, the Board \nwill thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations; \nevaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices \nthrough public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor \nand Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.\nA Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the \nstaff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and \nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.\nDepartmental/Bureau Overview\nInvestigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the \nCPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake \nCoordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of \nthe complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the \ncomplaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a \npreliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides \ndaily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and \nthe results are presented to the Board.  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an \ninvestigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through \ninvestigation to a public hearing at the Board\u2019s discretion.  Findings and recommendations resulting from public \nhearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board.  Patterns emerging from \ncomplaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy \nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.\nCommunity Education - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens \nand police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and \ncivilian expectations of police conduct.  Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and \npersonal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB\u2019s \nrole and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the \npublic is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen \nand the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as \noffensive.  The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the \nprocess, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.\nBoard and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance, \nincluding police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human \nrights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior.  Staff training \nis designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops \nmediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards \nand performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.\nAdministrative - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board \nand those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board.  Activities \nof this core service include the planning, organization, development, evaluation, and implementation of efficient \nand effective management strategies of fiscal, personnel, information systems, and related support to maximize \nthe utility of the resources available.

The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City\u2019s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, \nand improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.\nThe Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to \nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City\u2019s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant \nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our \ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain \ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed \nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, \nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows \nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the \nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.\nIn 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects \nsupported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding \nto rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield \nBridge supported by a State grant award.. \nNew Grants by Department, Office, or Bureau\n7.2%\n4.9%\n4.4%\n0.3%\n0.3%\n0.8%\n10.4%\n52.7%\n18.9%\nDPW\nBudget\nInnovation and Performance\nPlanning\nMayor's Office\nPolice\nFire\nOCHS\nPublic Safety -
